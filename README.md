# üß† Emotional Support Chatbot

This is a Deep Learning-powered **Emotion-Aware Chatbot** designed to provide **empathetic responses** to user messages. It combines emotion detection using a trained RNN model with natural language generation powered by **Gemini Pro**. The user interface is built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction and visualization.

## üìä Dataset & Emotion Labels

The dataset was extracted from **Reddit** and labeled manually across **9 emotion classes**:
It consists of 29,419 rows and 5 columns. 
The 5 columns are :
- Post_id
- Title 
- Text	
- emotion	
- subreddit (the community from where the post was scrapped)


The 9 emotion classes : 
- fearful
- depressed
- happy
- regret
- angry
- sad
- surprised
- neutral
- disgusted

Each Reddit post/comment was preprocessed, cleaned, and labeled using a structured pipeline.

## üßπ Data Cleaning Steps

The raw Reddit data was cleaned using:
- Lowercasing
- Removal of URLs, HTML tags, and special characters
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization
- Removal of stopwords

This ensured consistent and high-quality input for training.

## ü§ñ Model Training & Evaluation

Several models were trained and evaluated for emotion classification:

| Model              | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Naive Bayes        |    38%   |
| SVM                |    53%   |
| ANN                |   53.84% |
| RNN(Bidirectional) | **60.10%** |

The **Bidirectional RNN model in PyTorch** achieved the best trade-off between performance and interpretability and was chosen for deployment.
