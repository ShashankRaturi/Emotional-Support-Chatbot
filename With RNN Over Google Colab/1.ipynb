I have nothing to hide.. or so I thought. \\n\\n\\nI forget occasionally I'll send a random comment to a girl on gone wild.. saying looking good can't wait for more... something like that. \\n\\nI've only done it a few times in my time on reddit.. maybe to like 4-5 different  accounts that posted. I don't mean nothing by them.. just want to make the gone wild girls feel appreciated for what they Do. Stupid I know. Probably shouldn't have done it... \\n\\nWell she's pissed... we're supposed to get married soon.. but she is super pissed.. I never meant to hurt her. I feel horrible. I'm sleeping on the couch tonight.. I keep telling her the truth that it literally means nothing. . And I don't know why I do it... and to be honest I don't.. something was just like you should Comment on that... \\n\\nShe's the world to me.. and I don't know what to do.. I hope we can smooth this over..  I know I did wrong... but I wasn't trying to hurt feelings. . She's keeps saying it's over and such.. (Which she does a lot when we fight which isn't often but she's always threatens). I feel like an ass.. I am an ass.. \\n\\nI'm typing this on mobile while she's sleeping.  But I fucked up.. I hope everything will work out.. it's gotta.. \\n\\nToo much bad shit as been happening in the last 3 weeks.. this is the last thing anyone in the family would want to see... the wedding is supposed to be a happy time.. \\n\\nThing is these comments were from months ago.. and I don't even know why I did it.

I already have a problem learning new languages, it was never really my thing as a kid as Spanish was very difficult to learn even with Spanish speaking relatives. After brain trauma it\\u2019s been harder than before. Now onto my job.\\n\\nI work in Croatia at this awesome cafe/bar. My regulars are awesome people who have both watched and helped with my journey of learning the local language. They have helped me so much and never asked for anything in return. Many of them call me various nicknames of endearment and are very proud of their \\u201cAmerican Daughter-in-law\\u201d.\\n\\nEvery so often I get the wild card of just general mean person. I usually get a warning from one of my regulars or they will chew them out if they go too far. The normal for their rudeness is to shout their order as fast as possible before I can get a hello or good day out. I\\u2019ve worked here for over half a year now. After hearing these orders daily I am very confident and at least fluent in the range of my work. \\n\\nToday I got one of the biggest a-holes I\\u2019ve ever met. I can tell the difference between orders even with slang and dialect differences due to hearing them hundreds of times every day for months now and this man absolutely boiled my blood. There was no one else but me and him and he attempted to berate me for a solid 5 min about messing up his order. I know what he said, I may not be fluent in the whole language but I can tell the difference between coffee with milk and coffee with COLD milk. There is a very distinct difference even when spoken quickly.\\n\\nAfter a while of back and forth he demanded I make him a new drink for free. Now, I own my mistakes and will pay for a drink I make poorly and remake it but even then they still pay for at least one drink. He wanted BOTH drinks and wanted them both free. It was not happening. Anyway to make a long rant short I finally got one of my male coworkers who work in the attached gas station and the man was set straight. He was so pissed he had to pay and threw his change at me. It slid so hard one coin is still yet to be found but it\\u2019s only like ten cents so I\\u2019m not too fussed.\\n\\nMy male coworker laid into this man and he finally just hung his head and drank his drink. He tried to order another one but I refused unless he paid up front and he refused. I was so done and I am so fucking done with these kinds of a-holes. It\\u2019s all part of the work but I wish I could just throw it back at them harder.\",\n          \"This is something that have helped me alot during many years of drug addiction and even more years of depression and anxiety.

I have nothing to hide.. or so I thought. \\n\\n\\nI forget occasionally I'll send a random comment to a girl on gone wild.. saying looking good can't wait for more... something like that. \\n\\nI've only done it a few times in my time on reddit.. maybe to like 4-5 different  accounts that posted. I don't mean nothing by them.. just want to make the gone wild girls feel appreciated for what they Do. Stupid I know. Probably shouldn't have done it... \\n\\nWell she's pissed... we're supposed to get married soon.. but she is super pissed.. I never meant to hurt her. I feel horrible. I'm sleeping on the couch tonight.. I keep telling her the truth that it literally means nothing. . And I don't know why I do it... and to be honest I don't.. something was just like you should Comment on that... \\n\\nShe's the world to me.. and I don't know what to do.. I hope we can smooth this over..  I know I did wrong... but I wasn't trying to hurt feelings. . She's keeps saying it's over and such.. (Which she does a lot when we fight which isn't often but she's always threatens). I feel like an ass.. I am an ass.. \\n\\nI'm typing this on mobile while she's sleeping.  But I fucked up.. I hope everything will work out.. it's gotta.. \\n\\nToo much bad shit as been happening in the last 3 weeks.. this is the last thing anyone in the family would want to see... the wedding is supposed to be a happy time.. \\n\\nThing is these comments were from months ago.. and I don't even know why I did it.

I already have a problem learning new languages, it was never really my thing as a kid as Spanish was very difficult to learn even with Spanish speaking relatives. After brain trauma it\\u2019s been harder than before. Now onto my job.\\n\\nI work in Croatia at this awesome cafe/bar. My regulars are awesome people who have both watched and helped with my journey of learning the local language. They have helped me so much and never asked for anything in return. Many of them call me various nicknames of endearment and are very proud of their \\u201cAmerican Daughter-in-law\\u201d.\\n\\nEvery so often I get the wild card of just general mean person. I usually get a warning from one of my regulars or they will chew them out if they go too far. The normal for their rudeness is to shout their order as fast as possible before I can get a hello or good day out. I\\u2019ve worked here for over half a year now. After hearing these orders daily I am very confident and at least fluent in the range of my work. \\n\\nToday I got one of the biggest a-holes I\\u2019ve ever met. I can tell the difference between orders even with slang and dialect differences due to hearing them hundreds of times every day for months now and this man absolutely boiled my blood. There was no one else but me and him and he attempted to berate me for a solid 5 min about messing up his order. I know what he said, I may not be fluent in the whole language but I can tell the difference between coffee with milk and coffee with COLD milk. There is a very distinct difference even when spoken quickly.\\n\\nAfter a while of back and forth he demanded I make him a new drink for free. Now, I own my mistakes and will pay for a drink I make poorly and remake it but even then they still pay for at least one drink. He wanted BOTH drinks and wanted them both free. It was not happening. Anyway to make a long rant short I finally got one of my male coworkers who work in the attached gas station and the man was set straight. He was so pissed he had to pay and threw his change at me. It slid so hard one coin is still yet to be found but it\\u2019s only like ten cents so I\\u2019m not too fussed.\\n\\nMy male coworker laid into this man and he finally just hung his head and drank his drink. He tried to order another one but I refused unless he paid up front and he refused. I was so done and I am so fucking done with these kinds of a-holes. It\\u2019s all part of the work but I wish I could just throw it back at them harder.\",\n          \"This is something that have helped me alot during many years of drug addiction and even more years of depression and anxiety.

(again i'm really bad with emotions and stress). my husband came to bed a few hours later, and i couldn't stay there because i was so disgusted with myself that i didn't feel like i deserved to be anywhere near him. i let him sleep for a while before i woke him up and told him. basically he just laid there asking occasional questions and i sat on the floor crying and answering. 4 hours of mostly silence and crying later, he told me to go to sleep on my side of the bed and calm down. several hours later we both got up. he didn't really talk to me, but he got dressed and ready to run errands, and he saw that i hadn't really moved or done anything. he told me to get dressed and ready to go. i asked why and he told me not to argue. i didn't. we went and ran errands, he acted completely normal. like not a thing was wrong. it was icy out and he would offer his arm to help me from slipping or even when we were walking. he talked and acted totally normal. he won't touch me, and i really don't blame him, but he winks at me. he teases me. he treats me absolutely no different than normal. i hate it. i mean it's comforting to know that he's still himself, but i hate it that i'm sitting here loathing my entire existence and he still somehow loves me. i hate that i married such a good man, because he deserves so much more than me. i still have that little voice in the back of my head telling me \\\"he never specifically said that you were staying together, or that y'all will work it out, so don't get your hopes up.\\\" but how can i not when he treats me so freaking well? i love him. he's the best thing that has ever happened to me. i don't deserve him, and i wish he hated me as much as i hate myself.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"emotion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"happy\",\n          \"regret\",\n          \"sad\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29321,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ever find cling anger resent find actually one suffer instead person cause rage study show negative thought recur automate mean human natural collect emotional garbage usual ego great influence whether master art let go especially politics honest change anybody best case become polarized fight family best friend matter marginal impact life dive want take practice everyday worth try identifiy knowledge rather user allow constantly become defensive somebody attack belief take practice everyday worth end day biologically drive put force thing fit world start famiily conflict expand stranger reddit stop care trifle matter focus thing really meaningful u countless time thing ultimately hurt sake justice recognize urge justice fight win moment water friend bruce find useful come bonfire content elevate life k\",\n          \"stop relive moment head wake bed rub nose face make face make laugh realize love guess say anything ask could say think love freeze second smile say love warm fuzzy feeling heart amazing edit want thank everyone sweet reply really appreciate every one guy kind\",\n          \"use veteran smoker one day walk smoke get weird feeling chest heart beat fast sit rest bit start walk think much one day smoke start walk felt fast beating chest get feeling go die heart attack scared heart beat fast never happen get bad anxiety even call ambulance thinking go die thankfully find panic attack whatever call stop walk home fine try smoke day see weed something else smoke trhu dry herb vape feeling return weak last far less try smoke lil bit day kind make fear weed get mini panic attack one day feeling first time get panic attack im thinking take month break go able smoke happen much thc often take break system recover able smoke update dont smoke get weird anxiety go die shit suck dont know weed probably cuz get scar die heart attack go therapist probably\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

(again i'm really bad with emotions and stress). my husband came to bed a few hours later, and i couldn't stay there because i was so disgusted with myself that i didn't feel like i deserved to be anywhere near him. i let him sleep for a while before i woke him up and told him. basically he just laid there asking occasional questions and i sat on the floor crying and answering. 4 hours of mostly silence and crying later, he told me to go to sleep on my side of the bed and calm down. several hours later we both got up. he didn't really talk to me, but he got dressed and ready to run errands, and he saw that i hadn't really moved or done anything. he told me to get dressed and ready to go. i asked why and he told me not to argue. i didn't. we went and ran errands, he acted completely normal. like not a thing was wrong. it was icy out and he would offer his arm to help me from slipping or even when we were walking. he talked and acted totally normal. he won't touch me, and i really don't blame him, but he winks at me. he teases me. he treats me absolutely no different than normal. i hate it. i mean it's comforting to know that he's still himself, but i hate it that i'm sitting here loathing my entire existence and he still somehow loves me. i hate that i married such a good man, because he deserves so much more than me. i still have that little voice in the back of my head telling me \\\"he never specifically said that you were staying together, or that y'all will work it out, so don't get your hopes up.\\\" but how can i not when he treats me so freaking well? i love him. he's the best thing that has ever happened to me. i don't deserve him, and i wish he hated me as much as i hate myself.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"emotion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"happy\",\n          \"regret\",\n          \"sad\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29321,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ever find cling anger resent find actually one suffer instead person cause rage study show negative thought recur automate mean human natural collect emotional garbage usual ego great influence whether master art let go especially politics honest change anybody best case become polarized fight family best friend matter marginal impact life dive want take practice everyday worth try identifiy knowledge rather user allow constantly become defensive somebody attack belief take practice everyday worth end day biologically drive put force thing fit world start famiily conflict expand stranger reddit stop care trifle matter focus thing really meaningful u countless time thing ultimately hurt sake justice recognize urge justice fight win moment water friend bruce find useful come bonfire content elevate life k\",\n          \"stop relive moment head wake bed rub nose face make face make laugh realize love guess say anything ask could say think love freeze second smile say love warm fuzzy feeling heart amazing edit want thank everyone sweet reply really appreciate every one guy kind\",\n          \"use veteran smoker one day walk smoke get weird feeling chest heart beat fast sit rest bit start walk think much one day smoke start walk felt fast beating chest get feeling go die heart attack scared heart beat fast never happen get bad anxiety even call ambulance thinking go die thankfully find panic attack whatever call stop walk home fine try smoke day see weed something else smoke trhu dry herb vape feeling return weak last far less try smoke lil bit day kind make fear weed get mini panic attack one day feeling first time get panic attack im thinking take month break go able smoke happen much thc often take break system recover able smoke update dont smoke get weird anxiety go die shit suck dont know weed probably cuz get scar die heart attack go therapist probably\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 8,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          6,\n          7\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

life story. it includes stalking, sexual abuse etc. read thy rou hello reddit. this will be a long post. i\\u2019m not english speaking natively so please bear with me. i was thinking i would make a new account for this, which i did, but after further thinking i came to the conclusion; i don\\u2019t have anything to hide. i want everyone to see this as perhaps it could help you not judge yourself so hard; and even your fellow people. i don\\u2019t know how to start this either; all i know is that i need to get a few things off my chest. it\\u2019s been with me for years. this post is for me to let go of all of the past. i do hope i can inspire you (perhaps?) to try and do the same. anyone is able to change and how you have been in the past does not define you. please be kind to yourself; i\\u2019ve not been that to myself. i\\u2019m just a man from norway. i was lucky to have (still have) good parents. my dad was an alcoholic and on some occasions he would be too much. to the point where my older brothers had to carry him to bed. one day i had a friend over for sleepover and he had come home from night shift. i don\\u2019t know if he was drunk or just angry. we had locked the door and was screaming and making fun of everything. suddenly he kicks in the door and challenges me, telling me who is the boss is of the house and to be quiet; all while holding hands around my throat and strangling me. i don\\u2019t remember if this situation affected that me and my mom moved out eventually. we still had good contact with my dad for a long time. he was a great person when not drunk. one day he came drunk over and he beat my mom. i ran upstairs to my neighbors and the police brought him in. i didn\\u2019t speak to him for several months. one day i got a postcard with two dogs on it. my dad had written a letter and he had sobered up a lot. i forgave him. eventually my mom did as well. he never touched my mom or me again. when i was 13 i was sexually abused by my teacher several times. i was told to keep quiet and i was so afraid. threats and horrible things were said. i came clean when i was 18. my parents felt disgusted; but at the same time relief. relief that they had an explanation to why i started skipping school, why i locked myself in the room, the nightmares, my mental health; everything made sense. i had a lot of run ins with drugs and a few abusive ex-es. at one point i was 100 pounds. my mental health and physical health was declining so much. and one day my dad fell ill. somehow it didn\\u2019t hit me and i expected him to be much worse. i didn\\u2019t visit my mom or dad for a year or two. i can\\u2019t believe how far down i let myself go with the person i was with. it wasn\\u2019t love, it was an addiction. mostly to drugs and they enables it. i\\u2019ve always had an addictive personality. i need someone stable. i was having a lot of mental issues due to not eating and using drugs as well.. eventually i broke it off with the person that was the source of it all and got clean. i spent a few years living at my mom after that. spending time with her and my dad and my half brother on my moms side (the only one i really grew up with; the rest on my dads side had left due to his drinking) was living with his wife in an apartment very close. i spent my days getting healthy, eating, working and lifting weights. after a long time i was back to my old self. then i met a girl. this was going to be the best and worst relationship i had experienced in life. we shared a lot, we played games, we made the best love we both ever had and we were just happy. i fell in love hard and fast with her and she with me. i told you i had issues with my mental health right? this would unfortunately be our demise. my main problem is that i have debilitating ocd and ptsd. we\\u2019re talking paranoid thoughts, delusions, checking doors, checking looks, numbers must be correct, nothing can be not clean, rituals and so forth. this mixed with pent up anger and frustration due to the abuse i experienced in my past and the drugs and bad relationships led to me taking the anger out on her. i never touched her; but i did break things and yell. i remember one day she had dropped a bottle of ketchup on the ground and it spilled everywhere, she yelled for me and said sorry and was shaking. it clicked for me that day, i told her i would clean it up and she didn\\u2019t have to worry. eventually it was not enough. a week before i was going to start therapy she moved out. i remember it like it was yesterday and the day keeps haunting me. she had left home and came back with her father and just started moving out. and one point my mom arrived (due to me needing her there) and i overheard she and her speaking, that she still loved me and wasn\\u2019t sure if she wanted to move out. i understand today that it was my fault. it does not matter if her father was afraid i would hurt her or whatever it was. i had let it happen and i had scared her previously. people say your mental illness isn\\u2019t you; you just have a mental illness. i agree with that, no matter how hard it is to accept. here is the part of the story i\\u2019m most afraid to share. i\\u2019m ashamed of this. i hope the community here don\\u2019t excuse my behavior but rather can put themself in my shoes and ultimately understand me. a few weeks after our breakup we had a huge argument and i ended up trying to take my life. she broke down completely due to the way it went down. and i believe it perhaps changed her forever. i feel very guilty. she did the right thing and cut me completely out of her life. i wasn\\u2019t able to comprehend this at all. due to the forgiving nature i have. my dad, my teacher abusing me, friends i lost to suicide etc. i ended up stalking her for a while on social media, driving past her house, trying to call her. i would wait for her to call all the time to the point were i would feel horrible and on edge at any given moment. i would hear the doorbell and instantly think it was her. one day my phone called and it was actually her. she had just pocket dialed me and it devastated me. i would bury myself so deep in my own mind that i ended up not understanding that what i did was harassment. i never felt that i could be threatening or anything; i had no idea how i came across expect that i knew i loved her and something was not right. i kept going on with trying to contact her until she eventually went to the police and got an restraining order on me. which i broke a few times. not physically but i just couldn\\u2019t stop trying to get a hold of her. i just wanted to fix things (remember i said i have ocd right? yeah not a good match....) after a year of no contact and beating myself up i thought i was over her. until one day i realized the restraining order was over. i started to reach out again. apologizing for my behavior, that i just wanted to talk and make things right. not respecting her wish and understanding. i got a message back. it was not her that wrote it. i was told that i was sick and that i needed help and they felt sorry for me (in a demeaning way) telling me she wish i never existed. this hurt to the core. especially when time had stood still for me so long and she had just forgotten. it was so hard for me to understand how someone could seemingly force themself to move on and i was yet again just left behind feeling it was never resolved. i know she really loved me, more than anything, but things had been broken and she had moved on. that\\u2019s what hurt the most. knowing that my illness and me had ruined something beautiful. comically for me the police restraint letter was dated wrong and there was still a few weeks left of not being allowed to have contact. which resulted in a lot of stuff, a meeting from the police on the door, a little fine and an extension. there\\u2019s always two sides of a story and i did send angry texts as well. mostly idiotic rants where blaming everything would seem nice. then sending more text where i was sorry etc. looking back at this i can\\u2019t recognize myself. i was literally blinded by love. i was ready to do anything to get her back. i sometimes cry and dream about this. i feel horrible for the way i acted and if i could change it i would have never looked back the day we broke up. i never wanted to cause her pain, i just wanted to feel the love we had a little while longer. this resulted in me being ridiculed by mutual friends we had, being called stalker, getting rumors in the town sent around etc etc. i can\\u2019t dwell in my own sadness anymore, i\\u2019m so much more than that. i do really hope she is happy in life, and that she has grown to understand i never wanted to hurt her and that i\\u2019m not the same person anymore. wether or not that is a fact; is not my responsibility. it never was. i thought i had to redeem myself but i only had to forgive myself. if only i\\u2019d known that sooner. so i could avoid 6 years of emotional pain. i lost my dad in 2016. me, my mom, my brother and sister in law was the only one who showed up for his funeral burning his ashes. none of his other sons came. i don\\u2019t blame them. i\\u2019m happily engaged to a beautiful girl now. i\\u2019m stable, no drugs and a healthy body. i live near my brother, my mom and my sister in law. please never lose yourself like i did. it took time to come back from that. respect people\\u2019s wishes; no matter how hard it seems. take a step back and evaluate whole situation. scream! shout! feel! you\\u2019re allowed to you can\\u2019t control other people; but you can control yourself. i hope my story was worth your time... forgive. love fast. fall hard. welcome to wonderland \\u2764\\ufe0f\",\n          \"i'm in my 20's, and i was formally diagnosed with ocd a couple of years, but i've had it since i was 4 or 5 years old. my parents first took me to the doctors as a kid (aged 6) because i was having very dark, intrusive thoughts worrying that me or my family would come to harm, if i didn't perform certain actions or rituals. at the same time, i also had developed a huge fear of choking, and would refuse to eat in school or places i felt unsafe, because i was convinced that i would choke and die. to this day, i still struggle massively with eating and fear of choking, and it's been so bad the last couple of months i have had to chew up my food into microscopic pieces so that i can swallow or consume only liquids. i digress, i was put into therapy (aged 6) where i remember drawing pictures and colouring in, so i believe i was just prescribed a form of art therapy with the school counsellor. i didn't really open up to the therapist, because the other kids in my class kept asking me why i was taken out of class and why i had to visit the school counsellor. i didn't feel normal because of this, so i felt ashamed and i shut down and didn't speak. that therapy didn't do much, because the obsessive and compulsive thoughts returned. then, i was hyper focused on my health, to the point at 9 years old i convinced myself i had breast cancer (after a family member was diagnosed). i was so worried that i asked my parents to go to the doctor because my chest 'hurt' (from poking and checking my chest), because i was convinced i had breast cancer too and i could die. i didn't divulge the fears of breast cancer, i just said that my chest hurt, because i wanted the doctor to tell me i was okay. these problems have just got worse and worse. i have had terrible and daily intrusive thoughts during my childhood and teenage years, and was certain in my teens that i must be crazy and not 'normal'. however, now, i am hyper focused on my swallowing and my breathing, and these processes have turned from unconscious to conscious, and the focus on my swallowing has caused me to lose weight. i get incredibly worried about my health too. i check my blood pressure, oxygen saturation, my urine (with test sticks), my heart rate, my body for any signs of disease e.g lumps and bumps. i used to spend 6-10 hours a day of engaging in reassurance seeking behaviours. i used to check my vitals 100-200 times a day combined, because i was worried i would become unwell or get a life-ending illness. i don't remember a time that i felt normal. i don't remember a time where i wasn't mentally unwell. my aunt had ocd, but it developed in her 40's, and i felt somewhat envious, because she knew that 'normality' was possible for her. she knew what life was like \\\\*before\\\\*, during and after suffering with debilitating mental illness. now, she's better, and i am glad about that. but, part of me, deep down wants that healing for myself, but it doesn't seem possible. i don't know what my life would look like without mental illness, because my first memories in life are tainted by. i don't have a \\\\*before\\\\* or \\\\*after\\\\* mental health picture to look at. can anyone else relate?\",\n          \"about 4 years ago, i was sitting on the couch buying some loose leaf tea online. i sort of routinely talk to myself, and as i was looking at some lavender earl grey, i mumbled \\\"oooh! they have sachets!\\\" pronouncing it \\\"sa-shay\\\" (edit: have been alerted this could be written better as \\\"sach\\u00e9\\\") i learn a lot of new words through reading, and because of that am not always 100% sure on the pronunciation. it's at that exact moment that my then boyfriend walked into the room. without looking up from his phone, he says casually, \\\"it's pronounced 'sachetts'\\\" (rhymes with \\\"hatchets\\\") and then walks out of the room. i believed him, because well... he said it so confidently and casually, and usually if he's messing with me he breaks character. he didn't break character so like, he must know better than me, right? fast forward nine months. throughout this whole time, i haven't said this word out loud but every time i make a cup of this tea, i think \\\"sachett\\\" (rhymes with hatchet). so, we're at a gas station at 7am, fueling up before driving 5 hours to visit his family. i'm half asleep making gas station tea, and boyfriend peeks over my shoulder and goes \\\"oh! they have good sa-shays\\\". i freeze, and say coldly, \\\"what did you just say to me?\\\" \\\"isn't that how you pronounce it?\\\" asks boyfriend with a look of innocent confusion. i explain what had happened 9 months prior and his response was \\\"i don't remember that, but that sounds like me\\\" while laughing. it's been 4 years. boyfriend is now husband, and i still struggle (sometimes externally) with the correct pronunciation of \\\"sachet\\\" tl;dr sachet does not rhyme with hatchet, no matter what anyone says edit: thank you for the awards kind redditors!!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

out of curiosity. plus may aswel try right? i tried it once and thought that my dick-pumping crusade was over. welllllll not exactly. i always kept it under old furniture in my living room and completely forgot to throw away. few weeks go and when i went it to throw it, it wasn't where i left it.i am quite sure one day my girlfriend or her friends found it and told my friends. they all probably had a huge laugh, and now everyone knows. i know they know but i never said anything. now everytime someone says something indirectly to me about it like \\\"yea imagine using one of those\\\" i just sit quietly and ignore it while inside im screaming \\\"please kill me now\\\". my relationships with everyone has changed since my self esteem is so low and i have never admitted to it, even when people said something related to it, indirectly while im there, like expecting me to explain myself. thinking of leaving everything behind and starting a new life in fucking nowhere, or crashing my car into a pole. so apart from buying a better quality penis pump, any advice?\",\n          \"so in high school, i was in my first relationship. he was my first everything. and i would say i was in love with him even for years after our relationship ended. we broke up when i was 18 and he was 20. shortly after he started dating a girl who is now his wife. one night, close to the end of my senior year, i was at a party and i needed a ride home (couldn\\u2019t drive for obvious reasons) and the only person i felt i could trust to get me home safe was him. so i called him and he came, and took me home. i guess i confessed how messed up i was about the break up and him moving on so quickly, like the years we were together meant nothing to him. like the pieces of me i gave to him were worthless in his eyes. he didn\\u2019t say much, just walked me to my door and made sure i got inside safe. he texted to make sure i drank gatorade and had aleve ready for me to take when i woke up. two days later, he called. he said what i confessed was eating him up, and he wanted to see me. he wanted to meet up at a place that was special to us and \\u201ctalk\\u201d. the place i lost my virginity to him. i immediately said yes, so we made the plans. the day of, i couldn\\u2019t do it. i couldn\\u2019t do that to his so. i canceled, and told him i couldn\\u2019t break someone else the way i have been broken. he understood, and we never spoke again. for years, i regretted it. i always wondered \\u201cwhat if\\u201d. one day, he sent me a message, thanking me for saying all i said to him, and for refusing to see him. he said i forced him to grow up, and learn how to treat people who loved him and love them right in return. two days later, he was engaged. i locked myself in my room for 2 days and cried. when the two days were over, i felt a weight lifted off my shoulders. i felt free of him, of my want for what i imagined life with him would be. i am now married to a man who adores me, and have a beautiful daughter and another on the way. i am happy, i am successful, and i am loved beyond my wildest dreams. and i\\u2019d like to think i\\u2019d have none of this had i decided to hurt another woman. i made the right choice, and i have no regrets.\",\n          \"i really wish people followed a 24hr rule and got more information before social media nut jobs go crazy over viral clips. my heart sank and i was immediately pissed off when i saw the viral clips on twitter where kids w/ the maga hats looked like they were harassing an elderly na man. he looked like he could be my lolo albino and i just couldn't imagine myself walking up to someone elderly and choosing to target and harass them. i went searching for other video clips and information about the incident where they said that these kids approached the elder, interrupted a ceremony, got in his face and started chanting things like \\\"build the wall.\\\" i did not find evidence of that, but i did find a whole bunch of other footage and tried to piece everything together. i found a statement from one of the kids that a local reporter [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/aclementswkrc/status/1086822521012473858) w/ a bunch of video clips he mentions in the statement. 1st link: https://twitter.com/bendierker/status/1086846466205859840 2nd link: https://twitter.com/bendierker/status/1086846531398000640 3rd link: https://twitter.com/bendierker/status/1086846605612015616 - from a [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ec1_gcr34) that was originally posted by a religious(?) group that was there called the black hebrew israelites (bhi), it shows them street preaching to the na group, telling them that they're worshipping the wrong god, etc. some na people walked up to them offended and they got into a vocal spat at the beginning of the video. the group of kids aren't seen until [46:41](https://youtu.be/t3ec1_gcr34?t=2802), where one of the street preachers calls the kids fagg***, crackers, school shooters, etc) and they walk away ~5' later while they're being called animals. - the group of kids congregate off to the side seen on [1:05:00](https://youtu.be/t3ec1_gcr34?t=3927), waiting i assume for a bus to pick them up. bhi turns around and starts calling them names again and then the kids start what sounds like school chants and a mini haka at 1:09:00. i do not hear 'build a wall' in any of the videos. more kids meet up with the group; i guess that's the meeting place they were told to go to and they start doing another chant. one street preacher provides commentary on their chants. kids take a knee at 1:12:00 and bhi jokes(?) that they're kneeling to israel (them) and then the kids start another chant while the na group appears around 1:12:20 heading into the group of kids. some people in the na group were dancing as they meet the kids who were finishing up their chant. the kids turn around and start jumping up and down to the beat of the drums. no one tells the kids what they're doing; they're just beating drums at them and doing their own chanting. and while i might consider it disrespectful, it doesn't look malicious when the kids joined in the na chants (this is where all the shocking viral clips came from). these kids did not approach the na group, interrupting their ceremony. the rest of the video is bhi talking to some of the kids and trying to antagonize them. - close up of when the na group approached the student group as they were doing another chant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnljljuirg8 - another [video is one where the doxxed kid is standing in front of the elder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npx801xlsfy) the small group of kids confronting bhi starts chanting again and the rest of the group does as well. several kids in the back are dancing and look like they're enjoying listening to the drums and chanting from the na group. a couple of kids ask what is going on and wondering what the na group is doing at [1'06\\\"](https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=66) and [1'20\\\"](https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=82). people on social media were angry at pictures that looked like the doxxed kid was smirking at the elder, thinking that he was making fun of him or intimidating him. but it honestly looks like an awkward situation where someone approached right to him, looking at him and performing something. like, i myself would just stare and wait, listening until the elder was done like the kid was doing. - off to the side, a man from the na group is heard talking to another kid at [1:35](https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=95), saying \\\"white people, go back to europe where you came from...this is not your land...\\\" things get heated, and the doxxed kid who's facing the na elder turns to the other kid at [2:09](https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=129) and motions to him to just let it go and stop arguing while the elder is finishing his chant. that, to me, doesn't seem like a kid who is acting maliciously. things get even more heated from that one guy and it looks like some of the kids realize that these people don't like them and they walk away. the rest of the video is a kid again wondering what just happened, the na group finishes their performance and cheers w/ that one guy still being worked up, and more bhi preaching stuff where they call [\\\"trump a homosexual\\\"/rants about gays/etc](https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=437) and the kids are wondering where the buses are to leave and they get excited and chant again when the buses arrive. - after looking at what i think is everything, it's clear the social media mob is going after them for no reason. the viral clips look downright malicious and horrible out of context, especially when people who look at it automatically think these kids are evil just based on the hats they're wearing. it's clear they were not being malicious and it also looks like the viral clips were exploited for political propaganda. it's disgusting that adults would use kids this way for their own gain, and i'm sickened that people are still harassing and doxxing these kids. yesterday and even this morning there are people on social media who are asking their followers to literally assault these kids and ruin their lives for no reason except what they imagine. so far, 0 media organizations that wrote about the viral clips have not looked to see what actually happened. it's really disconcerting that we have reached the point at what i thought was still a civil society where hatred of someone is re-directed at kids. td;lr - street preachers (bhi) was on the second level of the lincoln memorial, saying antagonizing things to an na group that got in a scuffle with them and then left - maga students meet up a the memorial to wait for a bus. - the street preachers target the students, spouting slurs at them. students leave and go off to the side to do their school chants while they wait. - na group approaches the group of kids as they finish their chant and the kids turn to dance with the na group, thinking that they came to them to join them. no one says anything to each other for several minutes except for chanting and drumming. - one guy gets into argument w/student; doxxed kid turns to his friend and signals to cut it out and let it go. most of the kids leave to join other kids in front of the street preachers or elsewhere realizing that these pple don't like them. - bhi spouts homophobic things to the students again and targets a black student who was with the group, calling him names and saying that [\\\"they [white people] were going to take his organs\\\"](https://twitter.com/ava_quigley/status/1086796421226029056). students leave. the original narratives floating around were that: 1) the maga kids sought out the na group and surrounded them - false 2) a kid blocked the na elder from leaving - false 3) kids harassed black activists - false\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

new account for this, which i did, but after further thinking i came to the conclusion; i don\\u2019t have anything to hide. i want everyone to see this as perhaps it could help you not judge yourself so hard; and even your fellow people. i don\\u2019t know how to start this either; all i know is that i need to get a few things off my chest. it\\u2019s been with me for years. this post is for me to let go of all of the past. i do hope i can inspire you (perhaps?) to try and do the same. anyone is able to change and how you have been in the past does not define you. please be kind to yourself; i\\u2019ve not been that to myself. i\\u2019m just a man from norway. i was lucky to have (still have) good parents. my dad was an alcoholic and on some occasions he would be too much. to the point where my older brothers had to carry him to bed. one day i had a friend over for sleepover and he had come home from night shift. i don\\u2019t know if he was drunk or just angry. we had locked the door and was screaming and making fun of everything. suddenly he kicks in the door and challenges me, telling me who is the boss is of the house and to be quiet; all while holding hands around my throat and strangling me. i don\\u2019t remember if this situation affected that me and my mom moved out eventually. we still had good contact with my dad for a long time. he was a great person when not drunk. one day he came drunk over and he beat my mom. i ran upstairs to my neighbors and the police brought him in. i didn\\u2019t speak to him for several months. one day i got a postcard with two dogs on it. my dad had written a letter and he had sobered up a lot. i forgave him. eventually my mom did as well. he never touched my mom or me again. when i was 13 i was sexually abused by my teacher several times. i was told to keep quiet and i was so afraid. threats and horrible things were said. i came clean when i was 18. my parents felt disgusted; but at the same time relief. relief that they had an explanation to why i started skipping school, why i locked myself in the room, the nightmares, my mental health; everything made sense. i had a lot of run ins with drugs and a few abusive ex-es. at one point i was 100 pounds. my mental health and physical health was declining so much. and one day my dad fell ill. somehow it didn\\u2019t hit me and i expected him to be much worse. i didn\\u2019t visit my mom or dad for a year or two. i can\\u2019t believe how far down i let myself go with the person i was with. it wasn\\u2019t love, it was an addiction. mostly to drugs and they enables it. i\\u2019ve always had an addictive personality. i need someone stable. i was having a lot of mental issues due to not eating and using drugs as well.. eventually i broke it off with the person that was the source of it all and got clean. i spent a few years living at my mom after that. spending time with her and my dad and my half brother on my moms side (the only one i really grew up with; the rest on my dads side had left due to his drinking) was living with his wife in an apartment very close. i spent my days getting healthy, eating, working and lifting weights. after a long time i was back to my old self. then i met a girl. this was going to be the best and worst relationship i had experienced in life. we shared a lot, we played games, we made the best love we both ever had and we were just happy. i fell in love hard and fast with her and she with me. i told you i had issues with my mental health right? this would unfortunately be our demise. my main problem is that i have debilitating ocd and ptsd. we\\u2019re talking paranoid thoughts, delusions, checking doors, checking looks, numbers must be correct, nothing can be not clean, rituals and so forth. this mixed with pent up anger and frustration due to the abuse i experienced in my past and the drugs and bad relationships led to me taking the anger out on her. i never touched her; but i did break things and yell. i remember one day she had dropped a bottle of ketchup on the ground and it spilled everywhere, she yelled for me and said sorry and was shaking. it clicked for me that day, i told her i would clean it up and she didn\\u2019t have to worry. eventually it was not enough. a week before i was going to start therapy she moved out. i remember it like it was yesterday and the day keeps haunting me. she had left home and came back with her father and just started moving out. and one point my mom arrived (due to me needing her there) and i overheard she and her speaking, that she still loved me and wasn\\u2019t sure if she wanted to move out. i understand today that it was my fault. it does not matter if her father was afraid i would hurt her or whatever it was. i had let it happen and i had scared her previously. people say your mental illness isn\\u2019t you; you just have a mental illness. i agree with that, no matter how hard it is to accept. here is the part of the story i\\u2019m most afraid to share. i\\u2019m ashamed of this. i hope the community here don\\u2019t excuse my behavior but rather can put themself in my shoes and ultimately understand me. a few weeks after our breakup we had a huge argument and i ended up trying to take my life. she broke down completely due to the way it went down. and i believe it perhaps changed her forever. i feel very guilty. she did the right thing and cut me completely out of her life. i wasn\\u2019t able to comprehend this at all. due to the forgiving nature i have. my dad, my teacher abusing me, friends i lost to suicide etc. i ended up stalking her for a while on social media, driving past her house, trying to call her. i would wait for her to call all the time to the point were i would feel horrible and on edge at any given moment. i would hear the doorbell and instantly think it was her. one day my phone called and it was actually her. she had just pocket dialed me and it devastated me. i would bury myself so deep in my own mind that i ended up not understanding that what i did was harassment. i never felt that i could be threatening or anything; i had no idea how i came across expect that i knew i loved her and something was not right. i kept going on with trying to contact her until she eventually went to the police and got an restraining order on me. which i broke a few times. not physically but i just couldn\\u2019t stop trying to get a hold of her. i just wanted to fix things (remember i said i have ocd right? yeah not a good match....) after a year of no contact and beating myself up i thought i was over her. until one day i realized the restraining order was over. i started to reach out again. apologizing for my behavior, that i just wanted to talk and make things right. not respecting her wish and understanding. i got a message back. it was not her that wrote it. i was told that i was sick and that i needed help and they felt sorry for me (in a demeaning way) telling me she wish i never existed. this hurt to the core. especially when time had stood still for me so long and she had just forgotten. it was so hard for me to understand how someone could seemingly force themself to move on and i was yet again just left behind feeling it was never resolved. i know she really loved me, more than anything, but things had been broken and she had moved on. that\\u2019s what hurt the most. knowing that my illness and me had ruined something beautiful. comically for me the police restraint letter was dated wrong and there was still a few weeks left of not being allowed to have contact. which resulted in a lot of stuff, a meeting from the police on the door, a little fine and an extension. there\\u2019s always two sides of a story and i did send angry texts as well. mostly idiotic rants where blaming everything would seem nice. then sending more text where i was sorry etc. looking back at this i can\\u2019t recognize myself. i was literally blinded by love. i was ready to do anything to get her back. i sometimes cry and dream about this. i feel horrible for the way i acted and if i could change it i would have never looked back the day we broke up. i never wanted to cause her pain, i just wanted to feel the love we had a little while longer. this resulted in me being ridiculed by mutual friends we had, being called stalker, getting rumors in the town sent around etc etc. i can\\u2019t dwell in my own sadness anymore, i\\u2019m so much more than that. i do really hope she is happy in life, and that she has grown to understand i never wanted to hurt her and that i\\u2019m not the same person anymore. wether or not that is a fact; is not my responsibility. it never was. i thought i had to redeem myself but i only had to forgive myself. if only i\\u2019d known that sooner. so i could avoid 6 years of emotional pain. i lost my dad in 2016. me, my mom, my brother and sister in law was the only one who showed up for his funeral burning his ashes. none of his other sons came. i don\\u2019t blame them. i\\u2019m happily engaged to a beautiful girl now. i\\u2019m stable, no drugs and a healthy body. i live near my brother, my mom and my sister in law. please never lose yourself like i did. it took time to come back from that. respect people\\u2019s wishes; no matter how hard it seems. take a step back and evaluate whole situation. scream! shout! feel! you\\u2019re allowed to you can\\u2019t control other people; but you can control yourself. i hope my story was worth your time... forgive. love fast. fall hard. welcome to wonderland \\u2764\\ufe0f\",\n          \"i'm in my 20's, and i was formally diagnosed with ocd a couple of years, but i've had it since i was 4 or 5 years old. my parents first took me to the doctors as a kid (aged 6) because i was having very dark, intrusive thoughts worrying that me or my family would come to harm, if i didn't perform certain actions or rituals. at the same time, i also had developed a huge fear of choking, and would refuse to eat in school or places i felt unsafe, because i was convinced that i would choke and die. to this day, i still struggle massively with eating and fear of choking, and it's been so bad the last couple of months i have had to chew up my food into microscopic pieces so that i can swallow or consume only liquids. i digress, i was put into therapy (aged 6) where i remember drawing pictures and colouring in, so i believe i was just prescribed a form of art therapy with the school counsellor. i didn't really open up to the therapist, because the other kids in my class kept asking me why i was taken out of class and why i had to visit the school counsellor. i didn't feel normal because of this, so i felt ashamed and i shut down and didn't speak. that therapy didn't do much, because the obsessive and compulsive thoughts returned. then, i was hyper focused on my health, to the point at 9 years old i convinced myself i had breast cancer (after a family member was diagnosed). i was so worried that i asked my parents to go to the doctor because my chest 'hurt' (from poking and checking my chest), because i was convinced i had breast cancer too and i could die. i didn't divulge the fears of breast cancer, i just said that my chest hurt, because i wanted the doctor to tell me i was okay. these problems have just got worse and worse. i have had terrible and daily intrusive thoughts during my childhood and teenage years, and was certain in my teens that i must be crazy and not 'normal'. however, now, i am hyper focused on my swallowing and my breathing, and these processes have turned from unconscious to conscious, and the focus on my swallowing has caused me to lose weight. i get incredibly worried about my health too. i check my blood pressure, oxygen saturation, my urine (with test sticks), my heart rate, my body for any signs of disease e.g lumps and bumps. i used to spend 6-10 hours a day of engaging in reassurance seeking behaviours. i used to check my vitals 100-200 times a day combined, because i was worried i would become unwell or get a life-ending illness. i don't remember a time that i felt normal. i don't remember a time where i wasn't mentally unwell. my aunt had ocd, but it developed in her 40's, and i felt somewhat envious, because she knew that 'normality' was possible for her. she knew what life was like \\\\*before\\\\*, during and after suffering with debilitating mental illness. now, she's better, and i am glad about that. but, part of me, deep down wants that healing for myself, but it doesn't seem possible. i don't know what my life would look like without mental illness, because my first memories in life are tainted by. i don't have a \\\\*before\\\\* or \\\\*after\\\\* mental health picture to look at. can anyone else relate?\",\n          \"about 4 years ago, i was sitting on the couch buying some loose leaf tea online. i sort of routinely talk to myself, and as i was looking at some lavender earl grey, i mumbled \\\"oooh! they have sachets!\\\" pronouncing it \\\"sa-shay\\\" (edit: have been alerted this could be written better as \\\"sach\\u00e9\\\") i learn a lot of new words through reading, and because of that am not always 100% sure on the pronunciation. it's at that exact moment that my then boyfriend walked into the room. without looking up from his phone, he says casually, \\\"it's pronounced 'sachetts'\\\" (rhymes with \\\"hatchets\\\") and then walks out of the room. i believed him, because well... he said it so confidently and casually, and usually if he's messing with me he breaks character. he didn't break character so like, he must know better than me, right? fast forward nine months. throughout this whole time, i haven't said this word out loud but every time i make a cup of this tea, i think \\\"sachett\\\" (rhymes with hatchet). so, we're at a gas station at 7am, fueling up before driving 5 hours to visit his family. i'm half asleep making gas station tea, and boyfriend peeks over my shoulder and goes \\\"oh! they have good sa-shays\\\". i freeze, and say coldly, \\\"what did you just say to me?\\\" \\\"isn't that how you pronounce it?\\\" asks boyfriend with a look of innocent confusion. i explain what had happened 9 months prior and his response was \\\"i don't remember that, but that sounds like me\\\" while laughing. it's been 4 years. boyfriend is now husband, and i still struggle (sometimes externally) with the correct pronunciation of \\\"sachet\\\" tl;dr sachet does not rhyme with hatchet, no matter what anyone says edit: thank you for the awards kind redditors!!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

maybe make a statement regarding how this bill threatens the future of a free internet. how sopa does not include a due process in court, and how that is the problem. how sopa allows a \\\"guilty until proven innocent\\\" mode of operations and how that establishes a terrible precedent. edit 9: https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/petition/veto-sopa-bill-and-any-other-future-bills-threaten-diminish-free-flow-information/g3w1bscr?utm_source=wh.gov&utm_medium=shorturl&utm_campaign=shorturl\",\n          \"i spotted a little girl, about 2 years old, crying alone in shock and running around a fountain, looking around. i've lost my parents many times when i was a kid, and each was more terrifying than the previous, i immediately knew she was looking for her parents. i approached her and she was clearly terrified of me, so i guided her to a bench nearby with as little physical contact as possible. i started asking around if they lost a child and got people's attention. people gathered around but nobody was willing to go search the mother, it's a gigantic park with tons of people around. i left her in care of an old lady who was really concerned, and moved around asking questions. people actually talked about seeing a crying mother looking for her child, so i made for the last direction they saw her going. i ended up finding her almost near the edge of the park, around 300 meters away from the kid. she had her daughter who was crying her eyes out, and her (presumably) old mother with her who guided her around, because i could see the mother was slowly giving up hope and was stalling around like a zombie when i reached her. i can't describe their faces when i told them that i found their kid and she was safe. the grandma was laughing with joy, but the mother was crying silently but looked extremely relieved. i was surprised how far i came searching for her parents when i was guiding them to the kid. after painfully slow minutes we reached the lost child and she had around her a lot more people, and the rest was a really sweet wholesome scenery.
